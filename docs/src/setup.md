# Set Up

After you [installed](./install.md) lacy, you have to add it's shell configuration to your shell.

## Shell Setup

For more shell options, see `lacy init --help`.

### Zsh

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
eval "$(lacy init zsh)"
```

### Bash

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
eval "$(lacy init bash)"
```

### Fish

```bash
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish
lacy init fish | source
```

### Other shells

Feel free to contribute the init script for your preferred shell.

## Shell Options

You can customize the shell script that gets generated by using these options:

| Option | Default | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `--cd-cmd` | `cd` | Define the command to be used instead of `cd`. (e.g. `z`) |
| `--cmd`| `y` | The name of the main lacy command you use for navigating. |
| `--custom-fuzzy` | *none* | Configure this to disable lacy's built in UI selector and replace it with your own command. (e.g. `fzf`) |
