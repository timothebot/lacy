# Introduction

Lacy is a magical cd alternative that makes navigating much more efficient!

## Why?

Have you ever been annoyed after mistyping a directory name with the cd command,
or found cd autocomplete tedious when you have many similarly named directories?

Lacy solves this by improving the `cd` functionality in smart ways, but keeping it
as simple as `cd` - if you know `cd`, you know lacy!

But lacy also adds new features to make navigating in the terminal easier and faster!
