## Features

### Navigation without full path

You don't have to type the full directory name.
Just make sure the path matches the directory name more or less.

```sh
# normal cd
cd /Users/timothebot/projects/lacy/src

# with lacy
y / user timo prj lacy sr
# or
y / usrs timbo rojt layc rc
```

### Skipping directories

Forgot the directory name? No problem. Just skip it using `-`.

```sh
y / user timo - lacy sr

# as long as some parts are still unique, it will work
# ...and it's very fast
y / - - - lacy sr
```

### Like cd

Everything you can do with `cd`, you can do with `y`.

```sh
y /Users/timo/Projects/Lacy/src
y ~
y ..
```

### Real paths

You can also add real paths while lazy navigating.

```sh
y /Users/timo/ desk proj lacy/src
```

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Cargo (Universal)

```sh
cargo install lacy
```

#### Homebrew (macOS)

```sh
brew install timothebot/tap/lacy
```

#### NixOS (with Flakes and Home Manager)

Run `lacy` directly:
```sh
nix run github:timothebot/lacy
```

Or, add `lacy` to your system configuration:

Add `lacy` to your `flake.nix` inputs:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    lacy.url = "github:timothebot/lacy";
    # ... other inputs
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, lacy, ... }@inputs: {
    # ...
  };
}
```

Then, in your `home-manager` configuration, import the `lacy` module and enable it:

```nix
# home.nix
{
  imports = [
    inputs.lacy.homeManagerModules.default
  ];

  programs.lacy.enable = true;
}
```

Rebuild your system for the changes to take effect.

### Using as an Overlay

Alternatively, you can use the `lacy` flake as an overlay. This is useful if you prefer to manage your packages directly without using the provided Home Manager module.

#### For NixOS

1.  Add `lacy` to your `flake.nix` inputs.
2.  Apply the overlay to your NixOS configuration and add the package to `environment.systemPackages`.

    ```nix
    # In your NixOS configuration (e.g., /etc/nixos/configuration.nix)
    { pkgs, inputs, ... }: {
      nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.lacy.overlays.default ];

      environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.lacy ];
    }
    ```

#### For Home Manager

1.  Add `lacy` to your `flake.nix` inputs.
2.  Apply the overlay to your Home Manager configuration and add the package to `home.packages`.

    ```nix
    # In your home-manager configuration (e.g., ~/.config/nixpkgs/home.nix)
    { pkgs, inputs, ... }: {
      nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.lacy.overlays.default ];

      home.packages = [ pkgs.lacy ];
    }
    ```

### Shell Setup

#### Zsh

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
eval "$(lacy init zsh)"
```

#### Bash

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
eval "$(lacy init bash)"
```

#### Fish

```bash
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish
lacy init fish | source
```

#### Other shells

Feel free to contribute the init script for your preferred shell.

## FAQ

### Why does it need a shell script?

It is needed because you can't change the directory without using `cd`. So the shell script just executes `cd` if needed.

### Isn't it faster to use completions?

Yes. And no. Completions break, if you have a lot of similar named directories.

```
project_server/
project_web/
project_types/
```

For example, in this structure, you can just type `y web` instead.

### Why not `z`/`zoxide`?

`z` is a great tool, but if you are working with a lot of projects with similar paths, it can be a pain to navigate. `z` also needs to learn first, while lacy can be used on systems you (or lacy) never touched before.
You can use `z` alongside lacy.

### How can I use both Lacy and `z`/`zoxide`?

If you have `cd` aliased to `z`, then it should work as long as the Lacy shell eval is below the `z` eval.
If not, run `lacy init <shell>` and manually add the result to your shell config. Then, replace the `cd`'s with `z`.
