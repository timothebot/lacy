# Lacy ðŸ’¤

Lacy is a z inspired cd alternative. It aims to make navigating easier for lazy people.

## Example

```shell
$ cd /Users/timothebot/Desktop/projects/lacy/src

// with lacy
$ y / user timo desk proj lacy sr
```

## Why not `z`?

`z` is a great tool, but if you are working with a lot of projects with similar paths, it can be a pain to navigate.  
You can use `z` alongside lacy.

## Installation

### Zsh / Bash

Copy the function from the `shell.sh` file to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.

## Todo

- [ ] Add support for `~` and `~username` paths
- [ ] Add support for `..`
- [ ] Add support for "real" paths (e.g. `/Users/timo/ desk proj lacy`)
- [ ] Add ability to skip a directory
- [ ] Add tests
