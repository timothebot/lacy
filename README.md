## Features

### Navigation without full path

You don't have to type the full directory name.
Just make sure the path matches the directory name more or less.

```sh
# normal cd
cd /Users/timothebot/projects/lacy/src

# with lacy
y / user timo prj lacy sr
# or
y / usrs timbo rojt layc rc
```

### Skipping directories

Forgot the directory name? No problem. Just skip it using `-`.

```sh
y / user timo - lacy sr

# as long as some parts are still unique, it will work
# ...and it's very fast
y / - - - lacy sr
```

### Like cd

Everything you can do with `cd`, you can do with `y`.

```sh
y /Users/timo/Projects/Lacy/src
y ~
y ..
```

### Real paths

You can also add real paths while lazy navigating.

```sh
y /Users/timo/ desk proj lacy/src
```

## FAQ

### Why does it need a shell script?

It is needed because you can't change the directory without using `cd`. So the shell script just executes `cd` if needed.

### Isn't it faster to use completions?

Yes. And no. Completions break, if you have a lot of similar named directories.

```
project_server/
project_web/
project_types/
```

For example, in this structure, you can just type `y web` instead.

### Why not `z`/`zoxide`?

`z` is a great tool, but if you are working with a lot of projects with similar paths, it can be a pain to navigate. `z` also needs to learn first, while lacy can be used on systems you (or lacy) never touched before.
You can use `z` alongside lacy.

### How can I use both Lacy and `z`/`zoxide`?

If you have `cd` aliased to `z`, then it should work as long as the Lacy shell eval is below the `z` eval.
If not, run `lacy init <shell>` and manually add the result to your shell config. Then, replace the `cd`'s with `z`.
