```r
# If it works in cd, it works in lacy :D
cd /foo/bar/baz
y /foo/bar/baz


# Type faster!
cd Desktop/foo/bar
y dskt fooo bar
(?) Lacy allows you to type more naturally!

# Mistakes? Not with lacy!
cd /Users/tiimo
y / usrs timboo
# (?) Lacy uses a custom fuzzy algorithm specifically designed for terminal navigation!

# Quality of life!
cd ../../..
y ....


# Just skip directories with -!!
cd Desktop/foo/bar
y ....
(?) If you are not sure in what folder your target destination is, just replace it with - and let lacy handle it!
```
